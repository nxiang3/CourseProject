## The dataset includes the average of the mean and standard deviation of all data in X\Y\Z dimension for each subject. Also Each subject has six kinds of movement. 
## The procedure of merging data is given in the README.md
### Data Description

-timeBodyAcc-X: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the timeBodyAcc_Y and timeBodyAcc_Z files for the Y and Z axis. 

-timeGravityAcc-X: The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. Same for timeGravityAccMean-Y, timeGravityAccMean-Z.

-timeBodyGyro-X: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. Same for timeBodyGyroMean-Y, timeBodyGyroMean-Z.

-mean: averge value

-std: standard deviation

-^time: time measured

-^frequecny: frequency measured
